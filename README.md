### About

With the release of the most inspiring [Ultralight 1.2](https://ultralig.ht/) a few days ago, implementation of Ultralight in other Apps has become *much* easier. So I wrote this addon from scratch. Hence it is a very beginning only.
* For now only CPU rendering, GPU ist yet to come.
* Mouse klick implementation, but no scrollwheel so far. 
* Only beginning of keyboard implementation.
* Only windows for now. I will definetely do a Linux Version, though.
* *example-basic-CPU* shows how to use.
* *example-communication-GUI* is epty skeleton so far, did not start here yet.


## Installation

* Use project generator to build a project and include ofxUltralight. 
* Set it to x64 and build

(I use Visual Studio 2019 Platform Toolset v42. I have to retarget Solution when opening.)

I am very happy! Hope it works.
