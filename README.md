openframeworks 0.11.0 addon for ultralight-sdk-1.2-win https://ultralig.ht/ 
Ultralight (c) 2018 Ultralight, Inc. Ultralight is a trademark of Ultralight, Inc.

### About

With the release of Ultralight 1.2 a few days ago, implementation of Ultralight in other Apps has become *much* easier. So I wrote this addon from scratch. Hence it is a very beginning only.
* For now only CPU rendering, GPU ist yet to come.
* Mouse klick implementation. No key or scrollwheel at the moment.
* Only windows for now. I will definetely do a Linux Version, though.


## Installation

* Use project generator to build a project and include ofxUltralight. 
* Set it to x64 and build
(I use Visual Studio 2019 Platform Toolset v42. I have to retarget Solution when opening.)

See the example for usage.
